Arnav:
- We moved to manually making elements instead of using FullCalendar.Js and Vis.Js.
- We have finalized Timefold for scheduling.
- Additions to make:
1. Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity) and consider rate limiting login attempts to mitigate brute force attacks.
2. Instead of printing messages directly, consider using Python’s logging module to provide more flexible error tracking. 
3. Your extraction prompt is hard-coded in the function. It might be beneficial to move this prompt (or parts of it) to a configuration file or environment variable. This can make adjustments easier as your project evolves.
4. The use of time.sleep(0.02) in the loop simulating a streaming response is a simple solution, but it can be improved. Consider using asynchronous programming (e.g., using asyncio) if you plan on scaling or if you want a more responsive user experience.
5. Use ORM like ORM like SQLAlchemy 
6. Consider moving inline CSS from your HTML templates to separate CSS files. This will simplify maintenance and allow you to leverage browser caching.
